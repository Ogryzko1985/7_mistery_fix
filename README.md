# Quadratic Equations Solver

This is a  program - Quadratic Equations Solver.
You simply input 3 parameters(a,b,c) and get result- roots of Quadratic Equation.
If there is not any root  then the "none" word  is printed.


# How to Use
before launching the program make sure the  program file "quadratic_equation.py" is in current directory printed in console.
Use command "cd" to switch to directory the program file is in.
In console write "python quadratic_equation.py"
In console input after words "input(a,b,c)" any integer numbers.
After enter program counts roots of the quadratic equation or returns "none" if any root is absent.

# How to Launch Tests
before launching tests make sure  the  program file "tests.py" is in current directory printed in console.
Use command "cd" to switch to directory the program file is in.
In console write: python tests.py
If everything is ok then the program returns "ran 4 tests. in 0.000s. OK"
